  'password': "CMSC408_HW8_PASSWORD",
  'host': "CMSC408_HW8_HOST",
  'database': "CMSC408_HW8_DB_NAME"
}

cnx,config = create_db_wrapper( config_map )
  
```


```{python}
# Do a quick test of the connection and trap the errors better!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

```

# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 10
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  `Long Name`, `Region`
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
where
  region is NULL
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;
drop table if exists peopleroles;
drop table if exists people;
drop table if exists roles;
drop table if exists peopleskills;
drop table if exists skills;

```{python}
# create table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS
  wdi_country;
CREATE TABLE
  wdi_country as

```

```{python}
# show number of records
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
 COUNT(*)
FROM
  wdi_country
""")
```

## Task 5

According to the World Bank, in 2020 there were how many countries in the world?

```{python}
## (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
 COUNT(*) as 'Number of Countries in the World'
FROM
  wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Region`

```

## Task 7

How many countries are in each region?

```{python}
## How many countries are in each region?
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Region`, count(*) as "Count"
FROM
  wdi_country
GROUP BY
  `Region`
ORDER BY

```

## Task 8

List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america.

```{python}
## List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Long Name`, `Region`
FROM
  wdi_country
WHERE
  `Region` = 'North America'

""")

```

## Task 9

```{python}
## The last World Cup soccer tournament was hosted by Qatar.
## What region contains Qatar?  List the region, country short name and full name
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Region`,`Short Name`, `Long Name`
FROM
  wdi_country

  `Short Name` = 'Qatar'
""")

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Country Code`, `Short Name`, `2-alpha code`, `WB-2 code`, `Region`

## Task 11

```{python}
## Now, let's investigate the "income category" field.
## List the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Income Group`, count(*) as `Count`

```

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT

```

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

execute_ddl(cnx,"""

UPDATE 
  wdi_country
SET 
  `Income Group` = 'High income'

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Short Name`, `Income Group`

```

## Task 14

```{python}
## Write a single query that show the number of countries in each 
## "Region"-"Income Group" pair.  The table should have 3 columns:
## region, income group, and no.of.countries.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

  `Income Group`;
""")

```

## Task 15

```{python}
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

## Task 16

```{python}
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)

## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  As a hint,

## Task 18

```{python}
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

Oh boy, this took the SQL queries we were learning in HW 6 and 7 and turned it up 500%! I feel most confident in `SELECT` queries and all of the basic stuff, but I'm starting to get a hanf of the more complicated stuff. It just takes a lot of troubleshooting and asking ChatGPT for help.

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

Trick question! There was no task 23 or 24! *double checks report* I hope! But the last handful of **SUPER COMPLICATED** tasks I tried to just tackle one query at a time starting with what I could easily generate (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` etc.) and make sure I could generate those bits of data first. Then started adding `AS` naming schemes, `n.Regionetc.` naming, and tried to just slowly piece everything together. Then when stuck, asked our dear AI overlord.


3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

These are very helpful examples I can refer back to for our database project and/or **hopefully** a job. It's good to know all the intricate ways you can manipulate the data right from a  SQL session.
